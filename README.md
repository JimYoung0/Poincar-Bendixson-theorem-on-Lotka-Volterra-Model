I felt a little bit hard to visualize the PB theorem in my mind when i studied it.
But it is quite important for dynamics systems.
So i found a typical but easy model to visualize it

An interesting thing about this theorem is that,
the trapping region always exists,
but hard or impossible to find an exactly trapping region.

Hope you can understand what I was talking about above.
