I felt a little bit hard to visualize the PB theorem in my mind when i studied it during undergra.
But it is quite important for dynamics systems.
So i found typical but easy models to visualize it

The Poincare-Bendixson theorem states that, you need to determine a trapping region for a 2D dynamics systems first,
also, no steady states solutions in this region.
Then no fluid will escape out of the region.

This region would be called as a Trapping Region.

An interesting thing about this theorem is that,
the trapping region always exists,
but hard or impossible to find an exactly trapping region.

However, see the png2.
A guess would like, the trapping region might have a largest area.
Cuz you can find a trajectory leaks out.

Also notice that the prey-predator system does NOT satisfy the condition to use P.Bendixson
since it does have steady states
but it still has a closed orbit.

In conclusion, 2 interesting guessing in this note:
1. The trapping region might have a largest area
2. Still can find closed orbit solution when unstable steady states exist.
